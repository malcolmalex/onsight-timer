OnSight-timer
=============

The OnSight-Timer provides rock climbing competition organizers with a way
to display a countdown timer that gives competitors clear indications as to
the time left in transitions or climbing. It includes all the visual and audio cues
required by the USAC rule book for the 2015 season.

Users enter a transition time (optional) and a climbing time. These phases are repeated
until the organizers stop the timer. Audio and visual cues notify climbers of the
following:

- Beginning of transition (if used)
- Beginning of climbing
- One minute remaining in climb time
- Ten seconds remaining in climb time
- End-of-time
