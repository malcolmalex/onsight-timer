=============

The OnSight Competition Timer provides rock climbing event timers to assist
primarily with the management of isolation, rest, and climbing periods.

Competition organizers enter a transition time (optional) and a climbing time,
and these phases are cycled until the competition has ended. There are audio
announcements corresponding to the following times frames:

- Beginning of transition (if used)
- Beginning of climbing
- One minute remaining in climb time
- Ten seconds remaining in climb time
- End-of-time announcement

Font colors and announcements are in accordance with the USA Climbing rule book
for the 2015 season.
