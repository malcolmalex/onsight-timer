OnSight-timer
=============

The OnSight-Timer provides rock climbing competition organizers with a way
to display a countdown timer that gives competitors clear indications as to
the time left to climb. It includes all the visual and audio cues
required by the USAC rule book for the 2015 season.

Users enter a transition time (optional) and a climbing time,
and these phases are cycled until the competition has ended. There are audio
announcements corresponding to the following times frames:

- Beginning of transition (if used)
- Beginning of climbing
- One minute remaining in climb time
- Ten seconds remaining in climb time
- End-of-time announcement

Font colors and announcements are in accordance with the USA Climbing rule book
for the 2015 season.
